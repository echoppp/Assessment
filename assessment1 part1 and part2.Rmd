# RMarkdown editing

# Part one

## Load the packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
library(skimr)
```

## Create a variable with this dataset

```{r}
fastfood_calories <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2018/2018-09-04/fastfood_calories.csv")


fastfood <- fastfood_calories
```

## Display the first 10 rows of the dataset using head() and kable(). 
### 1.Display the first 10 rows

```{r}
head(fastfood, 10)
```

### 2.Display the first 10 rows of the dataset and the first 5 variables

```{r}
kable(fastfood[1:10,1:5])
```

# Part two
## 8.Display the observations that has more than 1000 calories

```{r}
fastfood %>%
  filter(calories > 1000)
```

## 9. Arrange observations with more than 40 in total_fat and more than 80 in total_carb in the descending order and save them to a new variable (dataset) called `dont_eat_this`

```{r}
dont_eat_this <- fastfood %>%
  filter(total_fat > 40 & total_carb >80) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_fat))
```

## 10. Using the initial dataset variable, use `case_when()` to create a new variable `heavy_food` which is equal to "heavy" when total calories are greater than 500, "low" when total calories are less than 250 and "average" for all other cases. Count the number of observations in each created category.

```{r}
heavy_food <- fastfood %>%
  mutate(heavy_food=case_when(calories > 500 ~ "heavy", calories < 250 ~ "low",
                              T ~ "average"))

heavy_food %>%
  count(heavy_food)
```

## 11. Display the types of variables in the dataset using `skimr` package

```{r}
skim(fastfood)
```

## 12. Present the count observations from each restaurant in a descending order

```{r}
fastfood %>%
  count(restaurant, sort = TRUE)
```

## 13. Using groupings (group_by()), summarise and display the average number of calories for each restaurant.

```{r}
fastfood %>%
  group_by(restaurant) %>%
  summarise(mean_calories = mean(calories)) %>%
  ungroup() 
```

## 14. Add variables to the dataset, which:
-  calculates the average calories per type of restaurant and call it `average_calories` 
-  calculates the maximum total_fat per type of restaurant and call it `max_fat` 
-  calculates the minimum cholesterol per type of restaurant and call it `min_cholesterol` 

```{r}
fastfood_analysis <- fastfood %>%
  group_by(restaurant) %>%
  mutate(average_calories=mean(calories)) %>%
  mutate(max_fat=max(total_fat)) %>%
  mutate(min_cholesterol=min(cholesterol)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

## 15. Display the data vis of total fat per each type of restaurant. Write a narration (2-3 sentences) why you believe this type of data viz presents such information best. 

```{r}
fastfood %>%
  group_by(restaurant) %>%
  ggplot(aes(total_fat, restaurant))+
  geom_col()
```

The variable of restaurant is a factor variable. So I think it can be group at firstly. And then the bar graph could clearly show the connections between different kinds of restaurants and total fat.

# 16. Add a variable to the dataset, which calculates the sum of cholesterol and sodium and call it `cholesterol_sodium`. Remove the variable `salad`

```{r}
fastfood_cs <- fastfood %>%
  mutate(cholesterol_sodium = sum(cholesterol + sodium)) %>%
  mutate(salad=NULL)
```

## problem 17. Use observations for Mcdonalds to plot sugar variable against protein with `geom_point()`

```{r}
fastfood %>%
  ggplot(aes(sugar,protein), Mcdonalds) +
  geom_point()
```

# Part three
## 18. Identify variable(s) which should be factors and transform their type into a factor variable.

```{r}
restaurant_kinds <- factor(c("Mcdonalds","Chick Fil-A","Sonic","Arbys","Burger King","Dairy Queen","Subway","Taco Bell"))
```

## 19. Create two new variables:Read about `cut_number()` function using Help and add a new variable to the dataset `calories_type`. Use `calories` variable for `cut_number()` function to split it into 3 categories `n=3`, add labels `labels=c("low", "med", "high")` and make the dataset ordered by arranging it according to calories.

```{r}
fastfood_caloriestype <- fastfood %>%
  mutate(calories_type = cut_number(calories, n=3, label = c("low", "med", "high"))) %>%
  arrange(desc(calories_type))
```
